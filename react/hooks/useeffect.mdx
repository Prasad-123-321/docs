```jsx
useEffect(setup, [dependencies]);
```

### Side Effects

As we build applications, we often need to synchronize with external systems. This can include things like:

- Making network requests
- Managing timeouts / intervals
- Reading/writing from localStorage
- Listening for global events

React calls all of these things “side effects”. If you’re **not connecting** to any external system, **you probably don’t need an Effect**.

### Connecting to the external systems

Some components need to stay connected to the network, some browser API, or a third-party library, while they are displayed on the page. These systems aren’t controlled by React, so they are called external.

To connect your component to some external system, call `useEffect` at the top level of your component:

```jsx
import { useEffect } from "react";
import { createConnection } from "./chat.js";

function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState("https://localhost:1234");

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect();
    };
  }, [serverUrl, roomId]);
  // ...
}
```

You need to pass two arguments to `useEffect` :

1. A **setup function** with setup code that connects to that system.
   - It should return a cleanup function with cleanup code that disconnects from that system.
2. A (Optional) **list of dependencies** including every value from your component used inside of those functions.

### Caveats

- `useEffect` returns `undefined`
- Effects only run on the client. They don’t run during server rendering.

### Example : Fetching Data with Effects

```jsx
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

export default function Home() {
  const [products, setProducts] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    let ignore = false;
    async function fetchProducts() {
      setLoading(true);
      const res = await fetch("https://dummyjson.com/products");
      const data = res.json();
      setLoading(false);
      if (!ignore) {
        setProducts(data.products);
      }
    }
    fetchProducts();

    return () => {
      ignore = false;
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      {loading ? (
        <p>Loading ...</p>
      ) : (
        <div>
          {products?.map((product, index) => (
            <div key={product.id}>
              <p>{product.title}</p>
            </div>
          ))}
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

Note the `ignore` variable which is initialized to `false`, and is set to `true` during cleanup. This ensures your code doesn’t suffer from **“race conditions”**, network responses may arrive in a different order than you sent them.

### What is Race condition ?

You would typically notice a race condition (in React) when two slightly different requests for data have been made, and the application displays a different result depending on which request completes first.
