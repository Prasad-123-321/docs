```jsx
const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);
```

### Reference

Call `useState` at top level of your component to declare a state variable

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";

function MyComponent() {
  const [age, setAge] = useState(28);
  const [name, setName] = useState("Taylor");
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState(() => createTodos());
  // ...
}
```

### Parameters

- `initialState`: The value you want the state to be initially. It can be a value of any type, but there is a special behavior for functions. This argument is ignored after the initial render.
- If you pass a function as `initialState`, it will be treated as an **initializer function**. It should be **pure**, should take **no arguments**, and should return a value of any type. React will call your initializer function when initializing the component, and store its return value as the initial state.
- `useState` returns an array with two values:
  - The current state. During the first render, it will match the initialState you have passed.
  - The `set` function that lets you update the state to a different value and trigger a re-render.

### `set` function

The `set` function returned by `useState` lets you update the state to a different value and trigger a re-render. You can pass the next state directly, or a function that calculates it from the previous state:

```jsx
const [name, setName] = useState("Edward");

function handleClick() {
  setName("Taylor");
  setAge((a) => a + 1);
  // ...
}
```

### Caveats

- `set` functions do not have return value.
- The `set` function only **updates the state variable for the next render**. If you read the state variable after calling the `set` function, you will still get the old value.
- If the new value you provide is identical to the current state, as determined by an `Object.is` comparison, React will skip re-rendering the component and its children.
- React updates the screen after all the event handlers have run and have called their `set` functions. This prevents multiple re-renders during a single event.

### Example One

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";

export const App = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // initial Value as 0

  const handleClick = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
    setCount(count + 1);
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  // After re-rendering a component on button click count value is 1

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count is {count}</p>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Increment Count</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

However, after one click, `count` will be 1 rather than 3. This is because calling the set function does not update the age state variable in the already running code. So each `setCount(couunt + 1)` call becomes `setCount(1)`.

To solve this problem, you may pass an **updater function** to setAge instead of the next state:

### Example Two (with updater function)

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";

export const App = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const handleClick = () => {
    setCount((c) => c + 1); // setCount(1)
    setCount((c) => c + 1); // setCount(2)
    setCount((c) => c + 1); // setCount(3)
  };

  // After re-rendering a component on button click count value is 3

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count is {count}</p>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Increment Count</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

Here, `c => c + 1` is your updater function. It takes the pending state and calculates the next state from it.

React puts your updater functions in a queue. Then, during the next render, it will call them in the same order:

- c => c + 1 will receive 0 as the pending state and return 1 as the next state.
- c => c + 1 will receive 1 as the pending state and return 2 as the next state.
- c => c + 1 will receive 2 as the pending state and return 3 as the next state.

There are no other queued updates, so React will store 3 as the current state in the end.

<Tip>
  By convention, itâ€™s common to name the pending state argument for the first
  letter of the state variable name, like a for count. However, you may also
  call it like prevCount or something else that you find clearer.
</Tip>
