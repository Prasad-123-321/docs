```jsx
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialArgs, init);
```

### What is `reducer` ?

Components with many state updates spread across many event handlers can get overwhelming. For these cases, you can consolidate all the state update logic outside your component in a single function, called a `reducer`.

### Reference

Call `useReducer` at the top level of your component to manage its state with a `reducer`.

```jsx
import { useReducer } from "react";

function reducer(state, action) {
  // ...
}

function MyComponent() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { age: 42 });
  // ...
}
```

### Parameters

- `reducer` : The reducer function that specifies how the state gets updated. It must be pure, should take the **state** and **action** as arguments, and should return the next state. State and action can be of any types.

- `initialArgs` : The value from which the initial state is calculated.

- **optional** `init` : The initializer function that should return the initial state. If it’s not specified, the initial state is set to `initialArg`. Otherwise, the initial state is set to the result of calling `init(initialArg)`.

### Returns

`useReducer` returns an array with exact two values

1. The **current state**. During the first render, it’s set to init(initialArg) or initialArg (if there’s no init).
2. The **dispatch** function that lets you update the state to a different value and trigger a re-render.

### `dispatch` function :

The `dispatch` function returned by useReducer lets you update the state to a different value and trigger a re-render. You need to pass the **action** as the only argument to the dispatch function:

```jsx
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { age: 42 });

function handleClick() {
  dispatch({ type: "incremented_age" });
  // ...
}
```

React will set the next state to the result of calling the `reducer` function you’ve provided with the current `state` and the action you’ve passed to `dispatch`.

### Parameters (dispatch)

- `action` : The action performed by the user. It can be a value of any type. By convention, an action is usually an object with a `type` property identifying it and, optionally, other properties with additional information

### Examples

```jsx
import { useReducer } from "react";

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "incremented_age": {
      return {
        name: state.name,
        age: state.age + 1,
      };
    }
    case "changed_name": {
      return {
        name: action.nextName,
        age: state.age,
      };
    }
  }
  throw Error("Unknown action: " + action.type);
}

const initialState = { name: "Taylor", age: 42 };

export default function Form() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

  function handleButtonClick() {
    dispatch({ type: "incremented_age" });
  }

  function handleInputChange(e) {
    dispatch({
      type: "changed_name",
      nextName: e.target.value,
    });
  }

  return (
    <>
      <input value={state.name} onChange={handleInputChange} />
      <button onClick={handleButtonClick}>Increment age</button>
      <p>
        Hello, {state.name}. You are {state.age}.
      </p>
    </>
  );
}
```
