## JSX

JSX stands for **JavaScript XML** and it is an **XML-like syntax** extension to ECMAScript. Basically it just provides the **syntactic sugar** for the `React.createElement(type, props, ...children)` function, giving us expressiveness of JavaScript along with HTML like template syntax.

In the example below, the text inside `<h1>` tag is returned as JavaScript function to the render function.

```jsx
export default function App() {
  return <h1 className="greeting">{"Hello, this is a JSX Code!"}</h1>;
}
```

If you don't use JSX syntax then the respective JavaScript code should be written as below,

```jsx
import { createElement } from "react";

export default function App() {
  return createElement(
    "h1",
    { className: "greeting" },
    "Hello, this is a JSX Code!"
  );
}
```
