```jsx
const cachedFn = useCallback(fn, dependencies);
```

### Reference

Call `useCallback` at the top level of your component to cache a function definition between re-renders:

### Parameters

- `fn` : The expensive function that you want to catche. React will return (not call!) your function back to you during the initial render. On next renders, React will give you the same function again if the **dependencies** have not changed since the last render.
  - Otherwise, it will give you the function that you have passed during the current render, and store it in case it can be reused later. React will not call your function. The function is returned to you so you can decide when and whether to call it.
- `dependencies` : The list of all reactive values referenced inside of the fn code. Reactive values include props, state, and all the variables and functions declared directly inside your component body.
  - React will compare each dependency with its previous value using the `Object.is` comparison algorithm.

### Returns

On the initial render `useCallback` returns the `fn` function you have passed.

During subsequent renders, it will either return an already stored `fn` function from the last render (if the dependencies haven’t changed), or return the `fn` function you have passed during this render.

### Usage

### Skipping re-rendering of components

When you optimize rendering performance, you will sometimes need to cache the functions that you pass to child components.

To cache a function between re-renders of your component, wrap its definition into the `useCallback` Hook:

```jsx
import { useCallback } from "react";

function ProductPage({ productId, referrer, theme }) {
  const handleSubmit = useCallback(
    (orderDetails) => {
      post("/product/" + productId + "/buy", {
        referrer,
        orderDetails,
      });
    },
    [productId, referrer]
  );
  // ...
}
```

You need to pass two things to `useCallback`:

1. A function definition that you want to cache between re-renders.
2. A list of dependencies including every value within your component that’s used inside your function.

On the initial render, the returned function you’ll get from `useCallback` will be the function you passed.

On the following renders, React will compare the dependencies with the dependencies you passed during the previous render. If none of the dependencies have changed (compared with Object.is), `useCallback` will return the same function as before. Otherwise, `useCallback` will return the function you passed on this render.

> In other words, useCallback caches a function between re-renders until its dependencies change.

### Examples

<CodeGroup>

```jsx App.jsx
import { useCallback, useState } from "react";
import { CounterTwo } from "./CounterTwo";

export default function Home() {
  const [count1, setCount1] = useState(0);
  const [count2, setCount2] = useState(0);

  function incrementCount1() {
    setCount1((prevCount1) => prevCount1 + 1);
  }

  const incrementCount2 = useCallback(() => {
    setCount2((prevCount2) => prevCount2 + 1);
  }, [count2]);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count One : {count1}</p>
      <button onClick={incrementCount1}>Increment Count 1</button>
      <CounterTwo count2={count2} setCount2={incrementCount2} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

```jsx CounterTwo.jsx
import { memo } from "react";

export const CounterTwo = memo(function CounterTwo({ count2, setCount2 }) {
  console.log("Counter Two rendered");
  return (
    <>
      <p>Count Two : {count2}</p>
      <button onClick={setCount2}>Increment Count 2</button>
    </>
  );
});
```
