title: "useContext Hook"
description: "`useContext` is a React Hook that lets you read and subscribe to context from your component."
icon: "code"

```jsx
const value = useContext(SomeContext);
```

<Tip>
  Context lets the parent component make some information available to any
  component in the tree below it—no matter how deep—without passing it
  explicitly through props.
</Tip>

### Reference

Call `useContext` at the top level of your component to read and subscribe to context.

```jsx
import { useContext } from "react";

export default function Home() {
  const Theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
  // ...
}
```

### Parameters

- `SomeContext` : The context that you've previously created with `createContext`. The context itself does not hold the information, it only represents the kind of information you can provide or read from components.

### Returns

`useContext` returns the context value for the calling component. It is determined as the value passed to the closest `SomeContext.Provider` above the calling component in the tree. If there is no such provider, then the returned value will be the **defaultValue** you have passed to `createContext` for that context. The returned value is always up-to-date. React automatically re-renders components that read some context if it changes.

### Caveats

- `useContext()` call in a component is not affected by providers returned from the same component. The corresponding `<Context.Provider>` needs to be above the component doing the `useContext()` call.

### Examples

```jsx
import { createContext, useContext, useState } from "react";

const ThemeContext = createContext("");

export default function Home() {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState("light");
  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={theme}>
      <button onClick={() => setTheme(theme === "light" ? "dark" : "light")}>
        Change Theme
      </button>
      <Box />
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
}

export function Box() {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
  return (
    <div
      className={`${
        theme === "light" ? "bg-gray-100 text-black" : "bg-gray-900 text-white"
      } h-[200px] w-[200px]`}
    >
      <h1>This is {theme.toUpperCase()} mode</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```
